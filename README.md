# Homesite

**edit: I ended up using Gatsby instead of Next.js but I wanted to leave this up because it is a nice template for anyone trying to build their site in Next.js**

Hello fellow Engineer!
This is my personal site built from some of my favorite technologies including Typescript, React, Next.js, express, Material-UI and more. Feel free to use any of the code for personal use.
